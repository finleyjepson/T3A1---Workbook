## Q1

### **Provide an overview and description of a standard source control process for a large project?**

A standard source control process for a large project involves using version control systems like Git or Subversion to manage and track changes to the project's codebase.

This process begins with the setup of a centralized repository where the project's code is stored. Team members clone this repository to their local machines, where they can work on different parts of the project simultaneously.

Changes are made locally and then committed to the local repository. Before these changes are merged into the main branch of the centralized repository, developers often create branches to isolate new work, ensuring the main branch remains stable. After local changes are tested and reviewed, they are pushed to the central repository.

A pull request is then opened for team review. Once approved, changes are merged into the main branch. This process facilitates collaboration, prevents conflicts, and maintains a historical record of changes, making it easier to track and revert modifications if necessary.

## Q2

### **What are the most important aspects of quality software?**

Quality software is defined by its ability to meet the needs and expectations of its users. The most important aspects of quality software include:

- **Functionality**: The software must perform its intended functions correctly and efficiently. It should be reliable, accurate, and provide the features and capabilities that users expect.

- **Usability**: The software should be easy to use and understand. It should have an intuitive user interface, clear documentation, and provide a positive user experience.

- **Reliability**: The software should be dependable and consistent. It should be free from errors, bugs, and crashes, and should perform consistently under different conditions.

- **Performance**: The software should be fast, responsive, and efficient. It should be able to handle large amounts of data and users without slowing down or crashing.

- **Security**: The software should be secure and protect user data from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. It should be resistant to attacks and vulnerabilities.

- **Maintainability**: The software should be easy to maintain, update, and modify. It should be well-structured, documented, and designed to accommodate future changes and improvements.

- **Scalability**: The software should be able to handle increased workloads and user demands without sacrificing performance or reliability.

- **Compatibility**: The software should be compatible with different platforms, devices, and environments. It should work well with other software and systems.

- **Compliance**: The software should adhere to industry standards, regulations, and best practices. It should be legal, ethical, and meet the requirements of its intended use.

## Q3

### **Outline a standard high-level structure for a MERN stack application and explain the components?**

A standard high-level structure for a MERN stack application consists of the following components:

- **Frontend**: The frontend is the user interface of the application, which is responsible for presenting data and interacting with users. It is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and is typically developed using a frontend framework like React.

- **Backend**: The backend is the server-side of the application, which is responsible for processing requests, managing data, and performing business logic. It is built using JavaScript and runs on a Node.js server. It interacts with a database to store and retrieve data, and it exposes an API for the frontend to communicate with.

- **Database**: The database is where the application's data is stored. In a MERN stack application, the database is typically a NoSQL database like MongoDB, which stores data in JSON-like documents. The database is accessed and manipulated using the backend server.

- **API**: The API is the interface that allows the frontend and backend to communicate with each other. It defines the endpoints and methods that the frontend can use to interact with the backend, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

- **Middleware**: Middleware is software that acts as a bridge between the frontend and backend, providing additional functionality and processing requests. It can be used for authentication, logging, error handling, and other cross-cutting concerns.

- **Deployment**: Deployment is the process of making the application available to users. It involves hosting the frontend and backend on a server, configuring the environment, and ensuring that the application is secure, scalable, and performant.

## Q4

### **A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?**

- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**: The team should be knowledgeable about SEO best practices and techniques. They should be able to optimize the website's content, structure, and performance to improve its visibility and ranking in search engines.

- **Security**: The team should be aware of security best practices and common vulnerabilities. They should be able to secure the website against attacks, protect user data, and ensure that sensitive information is handled safely.

- **Performance Optimization**: The team should be able to optimize the website's performance by reducing load times, minimizing resource usage, and improving responsiveness. They should be familiar with performance testing and optimization techniques.

- **Deployment and Hosting**: The team should be able to deploy the website to a hosting environment and configure the server. They should be able to manage the infrastructure, monitor performance, and ensure that the website is available and reliable.

- **Project Management**: The team should have project management skills to plan, organize, and execute the project effectively. They should be able to set goals, allocate resources, manage timelines, and communicate with stakeholders.

- **Communication and Collaboration**: The team should be able to communicate effectively and collaborate with each other, as well as with the client and other stakeholders. They should be able to share ideas, provide feedback, and work together to achieve the project's objectives.

## Q5

### **With reference to one of your own projects, discuss what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and to overcome challenges?**

In a recent project, I was tasked with developing a web application for a client using the MERN stack. To complete this project and overcome challenges, I needed the following knowledge and skills:

- **Web Development**: I needed a strong understanding of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used these languages to create the frontend of the application, designing the user interface and implementing client-side functionality.

- **React**: I needed to be familiar with React, a frontend framework that I used to build the user interface of the application. I used React to create reusable components, manage state, and handle user interactions.

- **Node.js and Express**: I needed experience with Node.js and Express to build the backend of the application. I used these technologies to create a server, define routes, and handle requests from the frontend.

- **MongoDB**: I needed to be proficient in MongoDB to design and manage the database for the application. I used MongoDB to store and retrieve data, define schemas, and perform queries.

- **API Design**: I needed to understand API design principles to define the endpoints and methods that the frontend could use to interact with the backend. I used RESTful API design to create a clear and consistent interface for communication.

- **Version Control**: I needed to be comfortable using Git to manage and track changes to the project's codebase. I used Git to collaborate with team members, share code, and manage conflicts effectively.
